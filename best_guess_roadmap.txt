Below is a roadmap that slots cleanly into the way your two modules already talk to each other. It starts with a quick‑win “good enough” scorer built on the data you already compute, then shows how to upgrade it to an information‑theoretic/entropy scorer (the gold standard described in most Wordle‑solver write‑ups). I’ve included the minimal code hooks you need in filters.py and gui.py.

1. Decide what “best” means
Strategy	What it optimises	When it’s useful
Letter‑coverage score (Easy)	Maximise the number of new high‑value letters you test in one go. Score = sum(letter‑frequency) – penalise repeats.	Early game, or when your candidate pool is still large (>50–100).
Expected‑elimination / entropy (Better)	For each guess, compute the distribution of feedback patterns over the candidate list and pick the guess with max entropy (equivalently, min expected remaining words).	Mid/late game when the pool is <200–300 words and speed is acceptable. This is the approach covered in the popular information‑theory articles.

You can wire in both: use coverage until the pool drops below N (say 250), then switch to entropy.

2. Add a scorer to filters.py

import math
from collections import Counter

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Quick letter‑coverage score (already have overall_distribution)
def score_coverage(word, overall_distribution):
    """Sum of letter frequencies, counting each letter once."""
    return sum(overall_distribution.get(ch, 0)
               for ch in set(word.lower()))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Entropy score
def score_entropy(guess, possible_words):
    """
    Expected information gain (bits) of `guess`
    given the current `possible_words` list.

    Complexity: O(len(possible_words)^2) naively,
    so call only when the pool is reasonably small.
    """
    pattern_counts = Counter()

    for answer in possible_words:
        pattern = get_feedback_pattern(guess, answer)
        pattern_counts[pattern] += 1

    total = len(possible_words)
    ent = 0.0
    for c in pattern_counts.values():
        p = c / total
        ent -= p * math.log2(p)
    return ent

# Needed helper: encode Wordle feedback as a small string / int
def get_feedback_pattern(guess, answer):
    """
    Returns a 5‑char string such as 'GYBBY'
    (G=green, Y=yellow, B=gray).
    """
    g = guess.lower()
    a = answer.lower()
    pattern = ['B'] * len(g)
    # Pass 1: greens
    for i, ch in enumerate(g):
        if ch == a[i]:
            pattern[i] = 'G'
            a = a[:i] + '#' + a[i+1:]   # mark used
    # Pass 2: yellows
    for i, ch in enumerate(g):
        if pattern[i] == 'B' and ch in a:
            pattern[i] = 'Y'
            a = a.replace(ch, '#', 1)
    return ''.join(pattern)

3. Pick candidate guesses

You have two natural sets:

    possible_words – the filtered list produced by filter_words
    (size =k, frequency already known).

    union_words – any word in your full dictionary, even if it’s already ruled out as the answer. These “off‑list probes” are useful for letter‑coverage in the early game (e.g. “adieu”).

In practice:

if len(possible_words) > 250:
    # use coverage; consider union_words
    scorer = lambda w: score_coverage(w, overall_distribution)
    candidate_pool = word_list      # or limit to top‑N by frequency
else:
    scorer = lambda w: score_entropy(w, possible_words_only)
    candidate_pool = possible_words_only

Compute each score and keep the top‑N (say 15) sorted descending.

4. Thread the result back to the GUI
a) In filters.py

Add a thin wrapper:

def best_guesses(possible_words, word_list, overall_distribution, cutoff=250, top_n=15):
    if cutoff is None or len(possible_words) <= cutoff:
        scorer = lambda w: score_entropy(w, possible_words)
        pool   = [w for w, _ in possible_words]    # just the words
    else:
        scorer = lambda w: score_coverage(w, overall_distribution)
        pool   = [w for w, _ in word_list]

    scores = [(w, scorer(w)) for w in pool]
    scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return scores[:top_n]

b) In gui.py

Inside on_filter_complete, after you compute overall_distribution but before re‑enabling the button:

# ----- Best Guesses -----
best_guess_list = filters.best_guesses(
    results,                # possible_words
    word_list,              # full dict
    overall_distribution
)
for word, score in best_guess_list:
    best_guesses_tree.insert("", tk.END, values=(word, f"{score:.2f}"))

5. UI polish

    The Best Guesses tree already exists in your layout, so no new widgets needed.

    Consider colour‑coding rows: green background for guesses that are still possible answers, gray for “probe words”.

    Show a tooltip or secondary column explaining whether the score is “entropy (bits)” or “coverage”, whichever you used.

6. Performance tips

    Memoise patterns: keep a 2‑level dict cache[guess][answer] of pattern codes so you don’t recompute them across turns.

    Vectorise: once the pool is small (<50) you can compute entropy in pure Python without UI lag; earlier than that, run it in the same worker thread you already use for filtering.

    Cut the candidate pool for coverage scoring to the top 2 000–3 000 frequency words; it barely changes results but halves runtime.

Recap

    Add two scoring functions in filters.py (coverage + entropy).

    Wrap them in best_guesses() that chooses which to use based on remaining pool size.

    Call that from on_filter_complete() and dump the list into the best_guesses_tree.
